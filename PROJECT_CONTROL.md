## Authoritative documents

Priority order when instructions conflict:

1. Live repository state and exact `main` evidence
2. `AGENTS.md`
3. `CURRENT_PHASE.md`
4. `docs/TASK_LEDGER.md`
5. phase-specific requirements in `execution/GSIP_Full_Execution.json`
6. `docs/FINAL_ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md`
7. `docs/UI_DESIGN_PARITY_GATE.md`
8. `docs/OWNER_LAST_EXECUTION_POLICY.md`
9. `docs/plans/GSIP_Complete_Implementation_Plan_AR.md`

No old prompt, screenshot caption, branch description, or stale ledger overrides live evidence.

## Phase policy

- Exactly one canonical current phase exists at a time.
- The current phase begins at P00.
- Future phases remain locked until the current phase is formally CLOSED.
- Phase exit requires implementation + tests + evidence + documentation reconciliation + pushed commit + required CI + exact-main recheck.
- Integration recovery and exact-main regressions take priority over new feature work.

## Branch and PR policy

- `main` is the canonical integrated branch.
- Workers must inspect active branches/PRs before creating new work.
- Use short-lived feature/recovery branches when parallel or reviewable work requires them.
- Never duplicate an active worker's legitimate scope.
- Merge only when repository permissions/policy authorize it and required checks pass.
- After merge, re-run the relevant acceptance on the exact new `main` SHA.

## Versioning

Use semantic versioning once the executable product exists. P00 must pin the initial product version, target .NET LTS/runtime, dependency policy, and artifact naming based on the supported build/deployment environment. Do not silently change pinned platform versions later.

## Setup contract

Normal Login is illegal before first-run setup completes. Setup must cover database connectivity, migrations, initial administrator, security baseline, organization/branding, integration environment, secrets placeholders, health review and Finish. Successful setup must persist a protected completed state and prevent accidental rerun.

## Security control

No live secrets or real personal data are allowed in Git. All sensitive runtime values must be stored through the approved configuration/secret-vault design and redacted from logs/audit/evidence.

## UI control

`docs/ui-baseline/` contains the mandatory v1 visual baselines. High-fidelity parity is a closure gate, not optional inspiration.

## Release control

A release candidate is valid only when source, tests, evidence, installer/package, hashes and CI all refer to the same exact commit. P17 is the only phase allowed to make a final-completion claim.
